## Hi = ¡Buenas!👋


💬 Hi, my name is Juan. My introduction should explain that I am involved in many things and, above all, that I would like to do many more. Professionally, I am also a lawyer and developer. I have a passion for both concentrated and scattered knowledge. If it can be learned, I believe I can learn it 💪🌱 

<sub>My WET nickname:</sub>
``` js
function transformName(name) {
  let transformedName = name.replace('uan', '');
  transformedName = transformedName.replace('nio', '');
  return transformedName;
}

const result = transformName('juan') + transformName('antonio') + 10 + 14;
console.log(result);
```
